# CodeAlpha-Internship-Task1-AgeCalculator

This project is an Age Calculator web application developed by MUB. It allows users to input their date of birth and calculates their age based on the current date.

The HTML structure includes elements such as a container, logo, calculator section, input box for date of birth, a button to calculate age, and a paragraph to display the result.

The CSS file styles the HTML elements, providing a visually appealing layout and design for the application.

The JavaScript code provides functionality to the web page. It includes a function calculateAge() to calculate the age based on the entered date of birth and the current date. It also includes a helper function getDaysInMonth() to get the number of days in a month. Additionally, it checks if a date is entered before performing the calculation.

Overall, the application is a simple yet effective tool for calculating age.
